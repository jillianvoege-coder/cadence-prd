# Persona: Maya Chen, Content Operations Lead

## Demographics
- **Age:** 34
- **Role:** Director of Content Operations at a B2B SaaS company (200-500 employees)
- **Reports to:** CMO
- **Team size:** 3 content writers, 1 SEO specialist

## Background
Maya spent 8 years as a content marketer before moving into operations. She's technically curious but not an engineer. She uses AI tools daily but lacks time to master prompt engineering or build custom workflows.

## Goals
- Maintain consistent publishing cadence across 6+ channels without burning out her team
- Ensure content aligns with quarterly strategic initiatives
- Prove content ROI to leadership with measurable pipeline impact
- Stay ahead of the shift from SEO to AEO (answer engine optimization)

## Pain Points
- Spends 40% of her week coordinating content requests from sales, product, and executives
- Internal knowledge (sales decks, customer calls, strategy docs) never makes it into external content
- No visibility into what competitors are publishing or how LLMs represent her company
- Content calendar is reactive—always chasing launches instead of building narrative momentum

## Behavior Patterns
- Checks Google Analytics and LinkedIn analytics daily
- Uses Notion for content calendar, Slack for requests, Google Drive for assets
- Evaluates tools based on time-to-value; abandons anything requiring >2 hours setup
- Trusts tools that show their reasoning, skeptical of black-box AI
